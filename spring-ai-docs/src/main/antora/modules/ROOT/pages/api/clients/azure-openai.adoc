= Azure OpenAI

Azure's OpenAI offering, powered by ChatGPT, extends beyond traditional OpenAI capabilities, delivering AI-driven text generation with enhanced functionality. Azure offers additional AI safety and responsible AI features, as highlighted in their recent update https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-azure-ai-services-blog/announcing-new-ai-safety-amp-responsible-ai-features-in-azure/ba-p/3983686[here].

Azure offers Java developers the opportunity to leverage AI's full potential by integrating it with an array of Azure services, which includes AI-related resources such as Vector Stores on Azure.


== Getting Started

Obtain your Azure OpenAI `endpoint` and `api-key` from the Azure OpenAI Service section on the link:https://portal.azure.com[Azure Portal].

Spring AI defines a configuration property named `spring.ai.azure.openai.api-key` that you should set to the value of the `API Key` obtained from Azure.
There is also a configuration property named `spring.ai.azure.openai.endpoint` that you should set to the endpoint URL obtained when provisioning your model in Azure.

Exporting environment variables is one way to set these configuration properties:

[source,shell]
----
export SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<INSERT KEY HERE>
export SPRING_AI_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<INSERT ENDPOINT URL HERE>
----

== Project Dependencies

Refer to the xref:getting-started.adoc#_dependency_management[Dependency Management] section to add Milestone and/or Snapshot Repositories to your build file.

Then add the Spring Boot Starter dependency to your project's Maven `pom.xml` build file:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-azure-openai-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

or to your Gradle `build.gradle` build file.

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.ai:spring-ai-azure-openai-spring-boot-starter:0.8.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
----

== Sample Code

This will create a `ChatClient` implementation that you can inject into your class.
Here is an example of a simple `@Controller` class that uses the `ChatClient` implementation.

[source,java]
----
@RestController
public class ChatController {

    private final ChatClient chatClient;

    @Autowired
    public ChatController(ChatClient chatClient) {
        this.chatClient = chatClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/ai/generate")
    public Map generate(@RequestParam(value = "message", defaultValue = "Tell me a joke") String message) {
        return Map.of("generation", chatClient.generate(message));
    }
}
----


== Azure OpenAI Properties

The prefix `spring.ai.azure.openai` is the property prefix to configure the connection to Azure OpenAI.

[cols="3,5,3"]
|====
| Property | Description | Default

| spring.ai.azure.openai.api-key |  The Key from Azure AI OpenAI `Keys and Endpoint` section under `Resource Management`  | -
| spring.ai.azure.openai.endpoint | The endpoint from the Azure AI OpenAI `Keys and Endpoint` section under `Resource Management` | -
|====

The prefix `spring.ai.azure.openai.chat` is the property prefix that configures the `ChatClient` implementation for Azure OpenAI.

[cols="3,5,3"]
|====
| Property | Description | Default

| spring.ai.azure.openai.chat.model | This is the value of the 'Deployment Name' as presented in the Azure AI Portal | gpt-35-turbo
| spring.ai.azure.openai.chat.temperature | The sampling temperature to use that controls the apparent creativity of generated completions. Higher values will make output more random while lower values will make results more focused and deterministic. It is not recommended to modify temperature and top_p for the same completions request as the interaction of these two settings is difficult to predict. | 0.7
| spring.ai.azure.openai.chat.top-p | An alternative to sampling with temperature called nucleus sampling. This value causes the model to consider the results of tokens with the provided probability mass. As an example, a value of 0.15 will cause only the tokens comprising the top  15% of probability mass to be considered. It is not recommended to modify temperature and top_p for the same completions request as the interaction of these two settings is difficult to predict. | -
| spring.ai.azure.openai.chat.max-tokens | The maximum number of tokens to generate | -
|====

The prefix `spring.ai.azure.openai.embeddings` is the property prefix that configures the `EmbeddingClient` implementation for Azure OoenAI

[cols="3,5,3"]
|====
| Property | Description | Default

| spring.ai.azure.openai.embedding.model | This is the value of the 'Deployment Name' as presented in the Azure AI Portal | text-embedding-ada-002
