= HuggingFace Chat

HuggingFace Inference Endpoints allow you to deploy and serve machine learning models in the cloud, making them accessible via an API.

== Getting Started

Further details on HuggingFace Inference Endpoints can be found link:https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/index[here].

== Prerequisites

Add the `spring-ai-huggingface` dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
   <artifactId>spring-ai-huggingface</artifactId>
   <version>0.8.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

You should get your HuggingFace API key and set it as an environment variable

[source,shell]
----
export HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
----

Note, there is not yet a Spring Boot Starter for this client implementation.

Obtain the endpoint URL of the Inference Endpoint.
You can find this on the Inference Endpoint's UI link:https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/[here].

== Making a call to the model

[source,java]
----
HuggingfaceChatClient client = new HuggingfaceChatClient(apiKey, basePath);
Prompt prompt = new Prompt("Your text here...");
ChatResponse response = client.call(prompt);
System.out.println(response.getGeneration().getText());
----

== Example

Using the example found link:https://www.promptingguide.ai/models/mistral-7b[here]

[source,java]
----
String mistral7bInstruct = """
        [INST] You are a helpful code assistant. Your task is to generate a valid JSON object based on the given information:
        name: John
        lastname: Smith
        address: #1 Samuel St.
        Just generate the JSON object without explanations:
        [/INST]""";
Prompt prompt = new Prompt(mistral7bInstruct);
ChatResponse aiResponse = huggingfaceChatClient.call(prompt);
System.out.println(response.getGeneration().getText());
----
Will produce the output

[source,json]
----
{
    "name": "John",
    "lastname": "Smith",
    "address": "#1 Samuel St."
}
----
