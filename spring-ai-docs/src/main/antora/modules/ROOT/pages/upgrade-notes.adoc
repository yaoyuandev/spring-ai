= Upgrading to 0.8.0

== January 24, 2024 Update

* Moving the `prompt` and `messages` and `metadata` packages to subpackages of `org.sf.ai.chat`
* New functionality is *text to image* clients. Classes are `OpenAiImageClient` and `StabilityAiImageClient`. See the integration tests for usage, docs are coming soon.
* A new package `model` that contains interfaces and base classes to support creating AI Model Clients for any input/output data type combination. At the moment the chat and image model packages implement this. We will be updating the embedding package to this new model soon.
* A new "portable options" design pattern. We wanted to provide as much portability in the `ChatClient` as possible across different chat based AI Models. There is a common set of generation options and then those that are specific to a model provider. A sort of "duck typing" approach is used. `ModelOptions` in the model package is a marker interface indicating implementations of this class will provide the options for a model. See `ImageOptions`, a subinterface that defines portable options across all text->image `ImageClient` implementations. Then `StabilityAiImageOptions` and `OpenAiImageOptions` provide the options specific to each model provider. All options classes are created via a fluent API builder all can be passed into the portable `ImageClient` API. These option data types are using in autoconfiguration/configuration properties for the `ImageClient` implementations.

[WARNING]

== December 1, 2023

We are transitioning the project's Group ID:

* *FROM*: `org.springframework.experimental.ai`
* *TO*: `org.springframework.ai`

Artifacts will still be hosted in the snapshot repository as shown below.

The main branch will move to the version `0.8.0-SNAPSHOT`.
It will be unstable for a week or two.
Please use the 0.7.1-SNAPSHOT if you don't want to be on the bleeding edge.

You can access `0.7.1-SNAPSHOT` artifacts as before and still access https://markpollack.github.io/spring-ai-0.7.1/[0.7.1-SNAPSHOT Documentation].
